# hobbit-fitness-pal

This is an example app demonstrating a web and NativeScript application from one project. The purpose is to maximize code sharing between application.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) and [@nativescript/schematics](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-schematics).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a web dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Run `tns run ios --bundle` to run an iOS build of the NativeScript application. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Run `tns run android --bundle` to run an Android build of the NativeScript application. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`. Generating a component or module will generate shared as well as portions for both web and NativeScript.

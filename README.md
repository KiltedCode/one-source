Code for the talk _One Source to Rule Them All_.

## Abstract

We live in a world of applications. There’s a constant tug-of-war between wanting to maintain only one source code versus our app having a home everywhere our users are found. With Angular, we can write web apps that run great on both desktops and on mobile. When combined with NativeScript, we can take the next step and run our JavaScript natively on mobile devices. We’ll look at how to create both a web app and a native iOS and Android application from one codebase, sharing our code between the web and native. Together we can forge our apps using the power of Angular and Nativescript and finally have one source to rule them all.

> One Source to rule them all,  
One Source to find them,  
One Source to bring them all and in the Nativescript bind them.
